I got tired of the new [radar.weather.gov](https://radar.weather.gov) being both slow and IMO hard to read. So I made my own.

Maps currently come from the [Iowa Environmental Mesonet](http://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/), but I may move to making them myself with lambdas or something.

# Usage Tips
* The dropdowns to change map type and options are in the top right.
* `,` and `.` move between options in the last dropdown. This allows for quickly moving between say RADAR reflectivity and velocity maps.
